                                <p class="white-text"> Amanda is a clinical social worker who specializes in working with people who have survived trauma. She received her B.S.W. with a generalist perspective from Ferris State University in 2009 and her M.S.W. with an interpersonal practice perspective and trauma across the lifespan specialization from Western Michigan University in 2018. Amanda’s core belief is that people are inherently good; doing the best they know how to do with what they have, and that they would do better if they knew how to do better. 

                                    However, a variety of life events (especially trauma – an extremely upsetting event that overwhelms coping abilities and can produce psychological symptoms) can occur and lead a person down the road of making unhealthy life choices. This includes engaging in harmful coping mechanisms to meet their needs if they are not sufficiently supported in their mental health and social supports. As a result, the effects of trauma can be severe, pervasive and intergenerational if not properly addressed. Armed with this knowledge and training, Amanda practices from a trauma-informed cognitive-behavioral methodology, utilizing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (including Trauma Focused-CBT), Trauma Systems Therapy, Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, Mindfulness, as well as Strengths-based and Solution- Focused approaches. Through this trauma-informed lens, she asks the question “What happened to you?” rather than “What is wrong with you?” Amanda recognizes that traumatic events make people feel unsafe and powerless, and seeks to create an environment where clients can feel safe and empowered. Through the principles of honesty and teamwork, Amanda aims to reverse damaging trauma messages, such as “your voice doesn’t matter” and facilitate a transformation from just surviving to thriving.
                                    
                                    Amanda is experienced in working with children and adults, as well as individual and groups. She has worked in a variety of contexts including Catholic Social Services, Big Rapids Middle School providing bereavement services, Arbor Circle with homeless youth, Thresholds Inc. with developmentally disabled and mentally ill adults, St. Mary’s Hospital as an emergency social worker, and Our Hope Association providing services to women recovering from addiction in an inpatient setting. She also pulls from experience working with domestic violence/interpersonal partner violence, PTSD, CPTSD, co-dependency, anxiety, depression, personality disorders, substance use/abuse, 12-step programs, weight loss, and family court. When Amanda doesn’t have her nose stuck in trauma research, she enjoys watching her daughter in competitive dance, being at the beach, playing board games with family and friends, going to concerts, and unwinding with her favorite TV shows.
